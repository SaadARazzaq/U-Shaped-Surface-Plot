# U-Shaped-Surface-Plot📊🌈

A simple GUI application that creates interactive 3D U-shaped surface plots using `matplotlib` and `tkinter`. Select from a variety of colormaps to visualize data with vibrant colors. 🎨

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install required packages:

## Notes 📝

- The script uses matplotlib for plotting and tkinter for GUI components.
- The mpl_toolkits.mplot3d module is used for the 3D surface plot.
- The Plot is freely rotatable.
